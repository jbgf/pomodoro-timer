## User Interface

The Pomodoro Timer component provides a clean, intuitive interface with the following elements:

### Main Timer Display

![Pomodoro Timer UI](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98e3eb1d-4ebe-436b-890a-ca8cfcdc140c)

The main timer display is a circular progress bar that:
- Shows the current time remaining in minutes and seconds
- Visually represents the time elapsed as a circular progress
- Changes color based on the current mode (work/break)

### Control Buttons

The component provides two main control buttons:
- **Start/Pause button**: Toggles the timer between running and paused states
- **Reset button**: Resets the current session to its original duration

### Status Information

Below the timer, the component displays:
- The current mode ("Work Time" or "Break Time")
- The number of completed sessions for the current day

### Custom Content Area

You can add custom content between the timer and the controls, such as:
- Current task information
- Motivational messages
- Notes or reminders

## Features

### Core Timing Features

- **Work/Break Cycles**: Alternates between work and break periods
- **Automatic Transitions**: Can automatically transition between work and break
- **Visual Progress**: Shows time remaining with a circular progress indicator
- **Color Coding**: Uses different colors for work (red) and break (green) modes

### Automation Features

#### Auto-Start Work Sessions

When `autoStartPomodoros` is enabled:
- The first work session begins automatically when the component loads
- After a break ends, the next work session starts automatically

#### Auto-Start Breaks

When `autoStartBreaks` is enabled:
- Break sessions start automatically after a work session completes
- This allows for uninterrupted focus cycles without manual intervention

### Event Callbacks

The component provides callback functions to respond to timer events:

#### Session Completion Callback

- **onSessionComplete**: A callback function triggered when a session (work or break) is completed
- Provides session details including type, duration, and timestamp
- Can be used to implement custom behaviors or notifications when sessions end
- Useful for integrating with external systems like task trackers or notification systems

Example:
```jsx
<PomodoroTimer 
  settings={settings}
  onSessionComplete={(session) => {
    // Custom logic when a session completes
    if (session.type === 'work') {
      playCustomSound();
      showNotification('Work session complete!');
    } else {
      showNotification('Break time is over!');
    }
  }}
/>
```

### Session Tracking

The Pomodoro Timer keeps track of your productivity by:
- Recording session data (type, duration, completion status)
- Storing history in localStorage for persistence
- Displaying a counter for completed sessions

### Customization Options

The component can be customized in several ways:
- **Work Duration**: Set the length of work sessions (default: 25 minutes)
- **Break Duration**: Set the length of break sessions (default: 5 minutes)
- **Long Break Duration**: Set the length of long breaks (default: 15 minutes)
- **Sessions Until Long Break**: Set how many work sessions before a long break
- **Sound Notifications**: Enable or disable sound alerts when sessions end
- **Auto-Start Options**: Configure automatic transitions between sessions

## Use Cases
